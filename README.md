# Typescript and react practise program

This is just a simple project to teach myself the basics of using typescript and
react.

## Rough step-by-step guide

_Mostly just rewritten content from [this
website](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/react-&-webpack.html)._

- 1. Install deps
- 2. Install dev tools
- 3. Create `tsconfig`
- 4. Add initial React component
- 5. Add index.tsx which mounts the node
- 6. Add index.html with ref. to dev. version of react[-dom] and bundle.js
- 7. Setup webpack config
- 8. Run `webpack` to compile all the files, and open `index.html` in the browser
- 9. Add testing shim, setup and transpiler [from here](https://medium.com/@mateuszsokola/configuring-react-16-jest-enzyme-typescript-7122e1a1e6e8)
- 10. Test
